# Exploratory Data Analysis of Gene Expression in Dengue Spectrum Disorders

## Project Overview
This project conducts an in-depth exploratory data analysis of gene expression from various stages of dengue infection. Utilizing the GEO dataset GDS5093, we analyze gene expression profiles from patients across different stages of dengue infection to uncover unique patterns and potential biomarkers for disease progression and recovery.

## Dataset
The dataset includes profiles from:
- Dengue Fever patients
- Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever patients
- Recovery stage individuals
- Healthy controls

## Analysis Techniques
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality to highlight main variance components.
- **Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA):** Groups similar gene expression patterns.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification:** Differentiates between Dengue Fever and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.

## Results
- PCA reveals significant variance, indicating distinct genomic signatures.
- SVM classifier accuracy approximately 62.67%, with further refinement needed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Biopython (optional)

## Installation
Install the required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy bootstrapped
Usage
Run the analysis scripts provided in the repository to replicate the study or apply the methods to new data.
